Log::Stash::Manual::Concepts - The concepts behind the framework

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This framework tries to be a simplifying layer over message passing, allowing you to easily
make the networking parts of message passing become just configuration. This allows you to concentrate
on the hard parts (i.e. your application, not the message passing).

=head1 COMPONENTS AND CHAINS

There are only a few core concepts to grasp to use the framework. We'll start with the component types, and then
move onto chains.

There are only three types of components:

=head2 OUTPUTS

An output is simply a class with a C<consume> method. This will be called with a message
as it's only parameter, like this:

    $output->consume($message);
    
Outputs are expected to compose L<Log::Stash::Role::Output>.

=head2 INPUTS

An input is simply a class with an C<output_to> attribute. Your code just calls the consume
method on it's output, like this:

    $self->output_to->consume($message);
    
Outputs are expected to compose L<Log::Stash::Role::Input> which provides this attribute, and
use the C<BUILD> method from Moose to do any work needed to start listening for events.

=head2 FILTER

A filter is just a combination of an output and input. Some (or all) of the messages consumed
by the input are sent on to the output.

An optional L<Log::Stash::Role::Filter> is supplied, allowing you to provide a simple filter
method:

    with 'Log::Stash::Role::Filter';
    
    sub filter {
        my ($self, $message) = @_;
        return $message; # Or return undef to drop it
    }

However, if you want or need to, you can however write a filter manually, as:

    with qw/
        Log::Stash::Role::Input
        Log::Stash::Role::Output
    /;

    sub consume {
        my ($self, $message) = @_;
        # Do something to $message here
        $self->output_to->consume($message);
    }

As you've hopefully guessed now, a C<chain> is just an input, outputting to zero or more filters, which output to
an output.

=head1 DSL

So, this is all pretty easy, and you already know enough to pick up some components and use them! For example:

    use Log::Stash::Input::FileTail;
    use Log::Stash::Output::STDOUT;
    
    Log::Stash::Input::FileTail->new(
        filename => $ARGV[0],
        output_to => Log::Stash::Output::STDOUT->new,
    );
    AnyEvent->condvar->recv; # Enter event loop

There you go - you're tailing a file to screen - however you could just as easily by sending it over
the network with ZeroMQ or any other output.

This is, however, a bit ugly! If you're building a chain of several filters, or
you have several inputs being multiplexed into one output, then the code gets ugly fast.

To make it easy to build chains of processing, and your own scripts, a simple DSL is provided.
The example above becomes:

    use Log::Stash::DSL;

    run_log_server log_chain {
        input file => (
            class => 'FileTail',
            output_to => 'stdout',
        );
        output stdout => (
            class => 'STDOUT',
        );
    };

=head1 Event loop

L<AnyEvent> has been mentioned, and it's expected that logstash scripts will use a supported event
loop. This implies that your logstash code is asynchronous, which is generally fine - however it should
be noted that doing any long operation (non trivial database queries) will block the entire server - meaning
no events will be processed. 

In cases such as these, running a pool of worker processes to distribute the blocking jobs is more appropriate,
and easy to wire up (on one or more hosts). This is documented more fully in L<Log::Stash::Manual::Workers>.

=head1 ZeroMQ

L<ZeroMQ> is the recommended transport for logstash messages, and L<Log::Stash::Output::ZeroMQ> is designed to work
inside a traditional synchronous application. This means that you can emit messages into ZeroMQ without blocking your
application, or having to use or run the AnyEvent event loop.
